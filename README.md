KNN: 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a type of classification algorithm used in machine learning. It works by finding the k-nearest neighbors of a data point and predicting its class based on the most frequent class among the neighbors.
SVM:
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression. SVMs work by finding the hyperplane that maximally separates the classes in the feature space.
NB:
Naive Bayes is a type of probabilistic classification algorithm that is based on Bayes' theorem. Naive Bayes is a simple yet powerful algorithm that is used for classification tasks where we have a large number of features.
